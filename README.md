**Pascal** is a response to Matt Parkers Maths Puzzles #16.
It is a multi-threaded exhaustive search of all elements in a Pascal Triangle to find the most common values.

This should compile fine on both Linux and Windows (with MinGW), just run `make`.

Usage: ./main count print \[y/n\]

count specifies how many rows of the triangle to compute, 'y' or 'n' specificies whether to print out the triangle
